# Brand Guidelines for Technical Content

## Microsoft-Aligned Voice & Tone

### Core Principles
Our content creation follows Microsoft's Responsible AI principles:
- **Fairness**: Content is unbiased and inclusive of all perspectives
- **Reliability & Safety**: Accurate, verified technical information
- **Privacy & Security**: Never include PII or confidential data
- **Inclusiveness**: Accessible to diverse audiences and skill levels
- **Transparency**: Clear about limitations and uncertainties
- **Accountability**: Fact-checked and attribution-ready

### Voice Characteristics

#### Empowering
- Focus on enabling readers to accomplish their goals
- Use action-oriented language: "Build", "Create", "Deploy", "Transform"
- Highlight reader success, not tool features
- Example: "You can deploy your app to Azure in minutes" (not "Azure deploys apps fast")

#### Inclusive
- Write for global, diverse audiences
- Avoid idioms, cultural references, or region-specific examples
- Use simple, clear language - avoid unnecessary jargon
- Explain acronyms on first use
- Example: "Kubernetes (k8s) is a container orchestration platform..."

#### Clear & Direct
- Lead with value, then explain how
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Break complex topics into digestible pieces
- Active voice preferred: "The agent generates content" (not "Content is generated")

#### Professional but Conversational
- Approachable, not stuffy
- Use "you" and "your" to address readers directly
- Okay to use contractions: "you'll", "we're", "it's"
- Avoid overly casual language or slang

#### Trustworthy
- Cite sources for claims
- Acknowledge limitations
- Use data and evidence
- Correct tone: "Based on industry benchmarks..." (not "Everyone knows...")

### What to Avoid

❌ **Hype & Exaggeration**
- Avoid: "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "incredible", "amazing"
- Use: "Effective", "powerful", "significant", "valuable"

❌ **Jargon Without Context**
- Avoid: "Leverage synergies to optimize ROI"
- Use: "Use integrated tools to improve return on investment (ROI)"

❌ **Dismissive Language**
- Avoid: "Simply", "just", "obviously", "clearly"
- (These imply tasks are easy when they may not be for all readers)

❌ **Absolutes Without Evidence**
- Avoid: "Always", "never", "all", "none" (unless provably true)
- Use: "Typically", "often", "many", "most"

❌ **Gendered or Biased Language**
- Use: "They/their" for singular generic person
- Use: "Developer", not "guys who code"
- Use: "Staffing the team" not "manning the team"

### Content Structure Best Practices

#### Hook (First 1-2 sentences)
- Start with a relevant problem or question
- Connect to reader's experience
- Example: "Ever spent hours debugging a deployment issue, only to discover a misconfigured environment variable?"

#### Narrative Arc
1. **Problem**: What challenge does the reader face?
2. **Insight**: Why does this matter? What's the better way?
3. **Example**: Concrete implementation or use case
4. **Impact**: What changes when you apply this?

#### Call to Action (CTA)
- Clear next step for readers
- Questions to encourage engagement
- Resources for deeper learning
- Example: "Try this approach in your next sprint. Share your results or questions in the comments!"

### Responsible AI Alignment

#### Fairness
- Present multiple perspectives where relevant
- Avoid reinforcing stereotypes
- Highlight diverse use cases and examples

#### Reliability & Safety
- Verify all technical claims
- Warn about potential risks or pitfalls
- Provide safe defaults and best practices
- Example: "Always validate user input to prevent injection attacks"

#### Privacy & Security
- Never include:
  * Real customer names or data
  * API keys, passwords, or credentials
  * PII (emails, phone numbers, addresses)
  * Internal Microsoft information
- Use placeholder values: `your-api-key`, `example@company.com`

#### Transparency
- Acknowledge AI-generated content when relevant
- Clarify when giving opinions vs. facts
- Disclose limitations or edge cases
- Example: "This approach works well for small to medium datasets. For large-scale data, consider..."

#### Accountability
- Attribute ideas and code to sources
- Link to official documentation
- Encourage readers to verify information
- Be open to corrections and updates
